This repository contains a simple Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers.  It highlights a common programming error: the ZeroDivisionError that occurs when dividing by zero. The original code doesn't handle the case of an empty input list, resulting in this error.  The solution demonstrates how to gracefully handle this situation by checking for an empty list before performing the division.
